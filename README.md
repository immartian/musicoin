Musicoin is a blockchain platform, also it's a digital currency to incentivize musicians and listeners to transact directly without royalty intermediaries.To understand Musicoin, you have to know PPP first. As the centerpiece of Musicoin, Pay-Per-Play(PPP) is to address the fundamental issue in music industry, fair and in-time payment. If every play can be paid instantly, there won't be time issue; if every play can be counted with a standard unit,there won't be fairness issue. It's why PPP design is the unique part of Musicoin.
