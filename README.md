# What's Musicoin
> provide general and indepth documents based on wiki

Musicoin is a blockchain-based system for music transactions. Also it's a digital currency to incentivize musicians and listeners to transact directly to remove royalty intermediaries.Several smart contracts on blockchain in this design will safeguard Pay-per-Pay(PPP) model, to assure borderlessness, security, transparency and accountability.

To enable PPP, there must be some new mechanism beyond not only current royalty collection system but also putting more usability factors into design. Musicoin is trying to remove the payment barrier without going out to external system but enable listeners and musicians to exchange a digital currency instantly. Thus the transaction becomes an atomic operation without further complications.
