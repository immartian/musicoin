# What's Musicoin

Musicoin is a blockchain-based system for music transactions. Also it's a digital currency to incentivize musicians and listeners to transact directly without royalty intermediaries. Musicoin core system was build upon a modified blockchain from Ethereum. 

To understand Musicoin, you have to know PPP first. As the centerpiece of Musicoin, Pay-Per-Play(PPP) is to address the fundamental issue in music industry, fair and in-time payment. If every play can be paid instantly, there won't be time issue; if every play can be counted with a standard unit,there won't be fairness issue. It's why PPP design is the unique part of Musicoin.

To enable PPP, there must be some new mechanism beyond current royalty collection system, but also putting modern usability factors into considerations. In Musicoin system, there are several digital contracts on blockchain built upon PPP, to assure borderlessness, security, transparency and accountability. The contracts enable listeners and musicians to exchange a digital currency instantly, the same time well distribute to other participants of creative works.

PPP is the cornerstone of every future use cases in Musicoin system, we will explain it more in detail in https://github.com/Musicoin/musicoin/wiki.
