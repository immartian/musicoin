# What's Musicoin

Musicoin, a decentralized system for the publication and consumption of digital music based on cutting-edge cryptocurrency and peer-to-peer file sharing technology.  Musicoin allows musicians to publish a license as a “coded contract” directly to a decentralized database called a “blockchain”.  These contracts automate the collection and distribution of royalty payments and remain in the control of the artists themselves. Listeners can access a global catalog of music stored on a peer-to-peer file sharing system and pay artists directly using digital currency. Ease-of-use tools are provided to allow a seamless experience for both listeners and musicians, and an open protocol will allow third-parties to build a rich ecosystem of value-added software and services.  By providing a distributed and highly transparent platform that connects musicians and listeners directly, Musicoin lays the groundwork for a new age of music that is sustainable, borderless, and fair.

Musicoin is a blockchain platform, also it's a digital currency to incentivize musicians and listeners to transact directly without royalty intermediaries.To understand Musicoin, you have to know PPP first. As the centerpiece of Musicoin, Pay-Per-Play(PPP) is to address the fundamental issue in music industry, fair and in-time payment. If every play can be paid instantly, there won't be time issue; if every play can be counted with a standard unit,there won't be fairness issue. It's why PPP design is the unique part of Musicoin.

To enable PPP, there must be some new mechanism beyond current royalty collection system, but also putting modern usability factors into considerations. In Musicoin system, there are several digital contracts on blockchain built upon PPP, to assure borderlessness, security, transparency and accountability. The contracts enable listeners and musicians to exchange a digital currency instantly, the same time well distribute to other participants of creative works.

PPP is the cornerstone of every future use cases in Musicoin system, we will explain it more in detail in https://github.com/Musicoin/musicoin/wiki.
